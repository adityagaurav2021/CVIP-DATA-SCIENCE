Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism" is a data science project from Coders Cave that focuses on analyzing and understanding terrorism-related data. EDA is a crucial step in data science that involves exploring and summarizing the main characteristics, patterns, and insights of a dataset before applying further analysis or modeling techniques.

The project aims to investigate and gain insights into terrorism incidents using a dataset specifically curated for this purpose. The dataset may contain various attributes related to terrorist attacks, such as the date, location, type of attack, casualties, target, perpetrator, and other relevant information.
The project can be divided into several key steps:
* Data Collection: Gathering a dataset on terrorism incidents from various sources.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Using statistical techniques and data visualization to gain insights into the data, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, temporal analysis, geospatial analysis, target analysis, casualty analysis, and perpetrator analysis.
* Insights and Reporting: Summarizing the findings and insights derived from the analysis in a report format
